For this project, the only thing you need to ensure happens is that there are 2 folders titled '1' and '2' that are in the same directory as Main.java.
There are 12 additional files, 8 .png's and 4 .wav files. four of the png's are of black and white pointer hands. Put those and the .wav
files into folder 2. Put the remaining colored .png files in folder 1.
I suggest putting all three into a new folder. After that, load up your favorite IDE, open the folder you made
and run main.java. It will start the program where you will be asked to enter your name, biological sex, age, and then choose
either group 1 or 2. group 1 is visual only, group 2 has audio. Do not rename the files or the folders otherwise
the program will not work.
