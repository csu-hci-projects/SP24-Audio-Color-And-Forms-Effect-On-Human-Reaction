For this project, the only thing you need to ensure happens is that the folders '1' and '2' are in the same directory as Main.java
I suggest putting all three into a new folder. After that, load up your favorite IDE, open the folder you made
and run main.java. It will start the program where you will be asked to enter your name, biological sex, age, and then choose
either group 1 or 2. group 1 is visual only, group 2 has audio. Do not rename the files or the folders otherwise
the program will not work.
